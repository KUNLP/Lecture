this happens quite often with our customers when they do n't bring some of the necessary documents or requirements to complete their transactions . the best you can do is to check our website to see if you can do your transaction online so you do n't have to go to the dmv office . in case i have a problem with my insurance and your inquiry letter does not resolve the problem , what would happen .	in that case , we must suspend the vehicle registration and if the problem continues , your driver 's license . more than 300,000 registrations a year are suspended due to failing to maintain insurance .	if you fail to maintain an updated address with us ,	many dmv customers make easily avoidable mistakes that cause them significant problems , including encounters with law enforcement and impounded vehicles . because we see customers make these mistakes over and over again , we are issuing this list of the top five dmv mistakes and how to avoid them . 1. forgetting to update address by statute , you must report a change of address to dmv within ten days of moving . that is the case for the address associated with your license , as well as all the addresses associated with each registered vehicle , which may differ . it is not sufficient to only : write your new address on the back of your old license ; tell the united states postal service ; or inform the police officer writing you a ticket . if you fail to keep your address current , you will miss a suspension order and may be charged with operating an unregistered vehicle and/or aggravated unlicensed operation , both misdemeanors . this really happens , but the good news is this is a problem that is easily avoidable . learn more about how to change the address on your license and registrations [ 1 ] 2. leaving the state without notifying dmv states communicate with each other , so when you move to another state , be sure to tie up any loose ends regarding your new york state license or registration . that means resolving any unanswered tickets , suspensions or revocations , and surrendering your license plates to nys when you get to your new home state . a license suspension or revocation here could mean that your new home state will not issue you a license there . remember , it is important to notify dmv of your new address so that any possible mail correspondence can reach you . also , turning in your plates is important to avoid an insurance lapse . 3. letting insurance lapse because we all pay indirectly for crashes involving uninsured motorists , new york state requires every motorist to maintain auto insurance every single day a vehicle is registered . dmv works with insurance companies to electronically monitor your insurance coverage , and we know when coverage is dropped for any reason . when that happens , we mail you an insurance inquiry letter to allow you to clear up the problem . we send 500,000 inquiry letters a year . if the inquiry letter does not resolve the problem , we must suspend the vehicle registration and , if it persists , your driver license ! we suspend 300,000 registrations a year for failure to maintain insurance . if you fail to maintain an updated address with us , you won t learn that you have an insurance problem , and we will suspend your registration and license . make sure you turn in your vehicle s license plates at dmv before you cancel your insurance policy . insurance policies must be from a company licensed in new york state . learn more about insurances lapes [ 2 ] and how to surrender your plates [ 3 ] 4. understanding how much traffic points cost dmv maintains a point system to track dangerous drivers . often , motorists convicted of a traffic ticket feel they have resolved all their motoring issues with the local court , but later learn that the driver responsibility assessment dra is a separate dmv charge based on the total points they accumulate . the $ 300 dra fee can be paid in $ 100 annual installments over three years . motorists who fail to maintain an updated address with dmv may resolve their tickets with the court , but never receive their dra assessment because we do not have their new address on record . failure to pay the dra will result in a suspended license . learn more about about the nys driver point system [ 4 ] and how to pay driver responsibility assessment [ 5 ] 5. not bringing proper documentation to dmv office about ten percent of customers visiting a dmv office do not bring what they need to complete their transaction , and have to come back a second time to finish their business . this can be as simple as not bringing sufficient funds to pay for a license renewal or not having the proof of auto insurance required to register a car . better yet , don t visit a dmv office at all , and see if your transaction can be performed online , like an address change , registration renewal , license renewal , replacing a lost title , paying a dra or scheduling a road test . our award - winning website is recognized as one of the best in the nation . it has all the answers you need to efficiently perform any dmv transaction . consider signing up for our mydmv service , which offers even more benefits . sign up or log into mydmv [ 6 ]

yes , your spouse 's retirement benefits will be reduced by a percentage based on number of months until their full retirement age . what will happen if the sum of the benefits is greater than the family limit ?	the family benefits will be reduced ; but your benefits will not be affected .	when benefits are payable to your spouse :	when you start receiving disability benefits , certain members of your family may also qualify for benefits on your record . benefits may be paid to your : spouse ; divorced spouse ; children ; disabled child ; and adult child disabled before age 22. if any of your qualified family members apply for benefits , we will ask for their social security numbers and their birth certificates . if your spouse is applying for benefits , we may also ask for proof of marriage and dates of prior marriages , if applicable . maximum family amount each family member may be eligible for a monthly benefit of up to 50 percent of your disability benefit amount . however , there is a limit to the amount we can pay your family . the total depends on your benefit amount and the number of family members who also qualify on your record . the total varies , but generally the total amount you and your family can receive is between 150 and 180 percent of your disability benefit . if the sum of the benefits payable on your account is greater than the family limit , the benefits to the family members will be reduced proportionately . your benefit will not be affected . benefits for your spouse when benefits are payable to your spouse : age 62 or older , unless he or she collects a higher social security benefit based on his or her earnings record . the spouse benefit amount will be permanently reduced by a percentage based on the number of months until his or her full retirement age . at any age if he or she is caring for your child under age 16 or disabled . your spouse would receive these benefits until the child reaches age 16. at that time , the child 's benefits continue , but your spouse 's benefits stop unless he or she is old enough to receive retirement benefits age 62 or older or survivor benefits as a widow or widower age 60. if your spouse also worked under social security if your spouse is eligible for retirement benefits on his or her own record , we will always pay that amount first . but if the spouse benefit that is payable on your record is a higher amount , he or she will get a combination of benefits that equals that higher amount . if your spouse will also receive a pension based on work not covered by social security , such as government or foreign work , his or her social security benefit on your record may be affected . benefits for your divorced spouse if you are divorced , even if you have remarried , your ex - spouse may qualify for benefits on your record . if your ex - spouse will also receive a pension based on work not covered by social security , such as government or foreign work , his or her social security benefit on your record may be affected . to qualify on your record , your ex - spouse must : have been married to you for at least 10 years ; be at least 62 years old ; be unmarried ; and not be eligible for an equal or higher benefit on his or her own social security record , or on someone else 's social security record . benefits for your children when you qualify for social security disability benefits , your children may also qualify to receive benefits on your record . your eligible child can be your biological child , adopted child , or stepchild . a dependent grandchild may also qualify . to receive benefits , the child must be unmarried and be : under age 18 ; or 18 - 19 years old and a full - time student no higher than grade 12 ; or 18 or older and have a disability that started before age 22. normally , benefits stop when children reach age 18 unless they are disabled . however , if the child is still a full - time student at a secondary or elementary school at age 18 , benefits will continue until the child graduates or until two months after the child becomes age 19 , whichever is first . find out more about benefits for a disabled child . publications disability benefits benefits for children what you need to know when you get social security disability benefits information for government employees benefits for children with disabilities
yes , back to that . there is no `` best age `` , it 's your choice . you should make an informed decision about when to apply for benefits based on your individual and family circumstances . should i just put it off for some time and not apply ?	yes , it 's up to you , but if you need to sign up for medicare but you do not , your medicare coverage may be delayed and cost more .please read the general and special enrollment period information on page 12 of our medicare booklet to find out what may happen if you delay .	other things to consider	benefits planner : retirement other things to consider what is the best age to start your benefits ? the answer is that there is no one `` best age `` for everyone and , ultimately , it is your choice . you should make an informed decision about when to apply for benefits based on your individual and family circumstances . your monthly benefit amount can differ substantially based on the age when you start receiving benefits . if you decide to start benefits : before your full retirement age , your benefit will be smaller but you will receive it for a longer period of time . at your full retirement age or later , you will receive a larger monthly benefit for a shorter period of time . the amount you receive when you first get benefits sets the base for the amount you will receive for the rest of your life . you may want to consider the following when you make that decision : if you plan to continue working , there are limits on how much you can earn each year between age 62 and full retirement age and still get all your benefits . depending on the amount of your benefit and your earnings for the year , you may have to give up some of your benefits . if your earnings will be high , you may decide to wait until full retirement age to start your benefits . once you reach full retirement age , there is no limit on how much you can earn . reminders : after you reach full retirement age , we recalculate your benefit amount to give you credit for any months in which you did not receive a benefit because of your earnings . when additional earnings appear on your record , we check whether they will increase your monthly benefit . if they do , we will send you a letter telling you your new benefit amount . you can apply for just medicare at age 65 and start receiving retirement benefits later . when you think about retirement , be sure to plan for the long term . a man who turned 65 in 2014 can expect to live about another 19.3 years . a woman who turned 65 the same year can expect to live about another 21.6 years . and those are just averages . about one out of every four 65-year - olds today will live past age 90. one out of 10 will live past age 95. how long do you expect to live ? did your parents and grandparents all live into their 80s or 90s ? if the answer is yes , and you have every reason to believe you will too , you may want to delay starting your benefits until full retirement age or later . if they did n't , you may choose to start receiving retirement benefits earlier . if you come from a long - lived family , you may need the extra money more in later years , particularly if you may outlive pensions or annuities with limits on how long they are paid . if you are not in good health , you may decide to start your benefits earlier . if you stop working , not only will you lose your paycheck , but you may also lose valuable employer provided health insurance . although there are exceptions , most people will not be covered by medicare until they reach age 65. your employer should be able to tell you if you will have retiree health benefits or if you can temporarily extend your health insurance coverage after you retire . also , if you are married and your spouse is employed , you may be able to switch to their health insurance . should i apply for medicare ? remember , medicare usually starts when you reach age 65. if you decide to delay starting your benefits , be sure to contact social security about 3 months before you turn age 65 to check about applying for medicare . even if you have health insurance through a current or former employer or as part of yourseverance package , you should still check to see whether you need to sign up for medicare . some health insurance plans change automatically at age 65. if you need to sign up for medicare but you do not , your medicare coverage may be delayed and cost more . please read the general and special enrollment period information on page 12 of our medicare booklet to find out what may happen if you delay . if you are eligible on another record , you may have additional options : if you qualify for benefits as a widow , widower , or surviving divorced spouse on another record , you may choose to apply for survivors benefits now and delay your retirement benefit until later . if you delay receiving your retirement benefit until your full retirement age or later , your retirement benefit will be higher . if you were born before january 2 , 1954 and have already reached your full retirement age , and are eligible for a spouse s or divorced - spouse s benefit and your own retirement benefit , you can choose to receive only the spouse s benefit and delay receiving your retirement benefit until a later date . if your birthday is january 2 , 1954 or later , the option to take only one benefit at full retirement age no longer exists . if you file for one benefit , you will be effectively filing for all retirement or spousal benefits . if you do n't need your benefits immediately , you may decide to : wait beyond full retirement age to receive delayed retirement credits . reminder : if you are within 4 months of age 65 , or older , and you have health insurance through an employer or former employer , you should check to see whether you need to sign up for medicare . some health insurance plans change automatically at age 65. choose early retirement and increase the value of your benefits by investing them instead of spending them . reminder : if you 're receiving early retirement from your employer , keep in mind that some company pensions include a social security - equivalent supplement that stops automatically at age 62. the supplement stops because they assume you will apply for your retirement benefits at age 62. if your spouse or minor or disabled children will also qualify for benefits from your record , the value of their benefits , added to your own , may help you decide if taking your benefits sooner is your best choice . if your spouse or ex - spouse s date of birth is january 2 , 1954 or later and they become eligible to receive a higher benefit on your record while receiving retirement benefits , they can no longer delay filing for the additional benefit . if your spouse files for one benefit , they will be effectively filing for all retirement or spousal benefits . however , when you start your retirement benefits also affects the amount your surviving spouse may receive . if you start your benefits : before full retirement age , we can not pay your surviving spouse the full benefit amount from your record . generally , if you were receiving reduced benefits , we base the survivors benefit on that amount . after full retirement age , your surviving spouse may receive your full benefit amount plus any accumulated delayed retirement credits . accidents or unexpected changes in your circumstances ca n't be ruled out , of course , so your final decision may be based on your `` best guess `` about your future .

related monthly adjustment amounts ,	the law requires an adjustment to your monthly medicare part b medical insurance and medicare prescription drug coverage premiums . this affects less than five percent of people with medicare . most people don t pay higher premiums . if you have a higher income if you have higher income , you ll pay an additional premium amount for medicare part b and medicare prescription drug coverage . we call the additional amount the income - related monthly adjustment amount . here s how it works : part b helps pay for your doctors services and outpatient care . it also covers other medical services , such as physical and occupational therapy , and some home health care . for most beneficiaries , the government pays a substantial portion about 75 percent of the part b premium , and the beneficiary pays the remaining 25 percent . if we determine you re a higher - income beneficiary , you ll pay a larger percentage of the total cost of part b based on the income you normally report to the internal revenue service irs . you ll pay monthly part b premiums equal to 35 , 50 , 65 , 80 , or 85 percent of the total cost , depending on what you report to the irs . medicare prescription drug coverage helps pay for your prescription drugs . for most beneficiaries , the government pays a major portion of the total costs for this coverage , and the beneficiary pays the rest . prescription drug plan costs vary depending on the plan , and whether you get the extra help , also known as the subsidy , with your portion of the medicare prescription drug coverage costs . if you re a higher - income beneficiary with medicare prescription drug coverage , you ll pay monthly premiums plus an additional amount , which is based on what you report to the irs . because individual plan premiums vary , the law specifies that the amount is determined using a base premium . we tie the additional amount you pay to the base beneficiary premium , not your own premium amount . if you re a higher -

exempt interest income . if you file your taxes as married , filing jointly and your magi is greater than $ 170,000 , you ll pay higher premiums for your part b and medicare prescription drug coverage . if you file your taxes using a different status , and your magi is greater than $ 85,000 , you ll pay higher premiums . see the chart below , modified adjusted gross income magi , for an idea of what you can expect to pay . if you must pay higher premiums , we ll send you a letter with your premium amount and the reason for our determination . if you have both medicare part b and medicare prescription drug coverage , you ll pay higher premiums for each . if you have only one medicare part b or medicare prescription drug coverage you ll pay an income - related monthly adjustment amount only on the benefit you have . if you decide to enroll in the other program later in the same year , and you already are paying an income - related monthly adjustment amount , we ll apply an adjustment automatically to the other program when you enroll . in this case , we won t send you another letter explaining how we made this determination . remember , if your income isn t greater than the limits described above , this law does not apply to you . your tax return to determine your 2020 income -

can you tell me how the credits are obtained do you pay social security taxes ?	no	number of credits needed for disability benefits	social security credits you must earn at least 40 social security credits to qualify for social security benefits . you earn social security credits when you work and pay social security taxes . the number of credits does not affect the amount of benefits you receive . it only determines if you are eligible or not . you do not get extra benefits for earning more than the minimum number of credits . we can not pay benefits to you if you don t have enough credits . we use the amount of credits you ve earned to determine your eligibility for retirement or disability benefits , as well as your family s eligibility for survivors benefits when you die . how credits are earned since 1978 , when you work and pay social security taxes , you earn up to a maximum of four credits per year . credits are based on your total wages and self - employment income for the year . you might work all year to earn four credits , or you might earn enough for all four in much less time . the amount of earnings it takes to earn a credit may change each year . in 2020 , you earn one social security or medicare credit for every $ 1,410 in covered earnings each year . you must earn $ 5,640 to get the maximum four credits for the year . during your lifetime , you might earn more credits than the minimum number you need to be eligible for benefits . these extra credits do not increase your benefit amount . the average of your earnings over your working years , not the total number of credits you earn , determines how much your monthly payment will be when you receive benefits . read our publication , `` how you earn credits , `` for more information . number of credits needed for retirement benefits if you were born after 1928 , you need 40 credits to qualify for retirement . number of credits needed for disability benefits to be eligible for disability benefits , you must meet a recent work test and a duration work test . the number of credits necessary to meet the recent work test depends on your age . the rules are as follows : before age 24 - you may qualify if you have 6 credits earned in the 3-year period ending when your disability starts . age 24 to 31 in general , you may qualify if you have credit for working half the time between age 21 and the time you become disabled . as a general example , if you become disabled at age 27 , you would need 3 years of work 12 credits out of the past 6 years between ages 21 and 27. age 31 or older - in general , you must have at least 20 credits in the 10-year period immediately before you become disabled . the following table shows how many years of work credits you need to meet the duration of work test based on your age when your disability began . for the duration of work test , your work does not have to fall within a certain period . the table only provides an estimate of how many work credits you need . it does not cover all situations . if you are statutorily blind , you must only meet the duration of work test . when statutory blindness is involved , there is not a recent work test requirement . note : this table is an estimate only and does not cover all situations number of credits needed for survivors benefits the number of credits needed for family members to be eligible for survivors benefits depends on your age when you die . the younger you are , the fewer credits needed . nobody needs more than 40 credits . under a special rule , we can pay benefits to your children and your spouse caring for your children , even if your record does n't have the number of credits needed . they can get benefits if you have credits for one and one - half year 's work 6 credits in the three years before your death . if you are already receiving retirement or disability benefits at the time of your death , we will pay your survivors based on that entitlement . we will not have to determine your credits again .

currently , the federal student aid releases data for the 2018-19 cycle and provides a side-by-side comparison of the previous 2017-18 cycle . there 's also an archive that contains data files from the 2017-18 cycle comparing it to the past 2016-17 cycle . what kind of information are available through these files ?	only the number of submitted and completed fafsa forms . no personally identifiable information for any fafsa filer is shared .	basics	questions and answers about fafsa completion data below are questions we ve heard about the completion by high school and public school district '' > data we provide on fafsa completion by high school . basics missing or duplicate high schools low completion totals technical and analytical basics what is the source of data ? the source of the data is the u.s. department of education 's central processing system . what years of free application for federal student aid ( fafsa ) submission and completion data are available ? federal student aid releases data for the current 2018 19 cycle and provides a side - by - side comparison of the previous 2017 18 cycle . we also have an archive that contains data files from the 2017 18 cycle comparing it to the past 2016 17 cycle . each file has the previous cycle data through the same date in the prior year as well as the 6-month and 12-month numbers for the previous cycle . only numbers of submitted and completed fafsa forms are available . no personally identifiable information for any fafsa filer will be shared through this process . email us at hsfafsa @ ed.gov if you see data that is inaccurate and/or you have suggestions for improvement . we welcome your input . what is the difference between a submitted and a completed fafsa form ? submitted applications reflect all fafsa forms submitted by students at that high school . these applications , however , can be subsequently rejected by the central processing system if they are missing key pieces of information . the applications that are not rejected are referred to as completed applications . completed applications , therefore , are a subset of all submitted applications . if a fafsa form is submitted but not complete , the student will receive an email from the department of education asking him or her to correct the fafsa form . a completed fafsa form is necessary to determine eligibility for federal student aid and often other forms of financial aid . how often will the fafsa submission data be updated ? from october through june , data releases are weekly . for the remainder of the calendar year , data releases occur every other friday . ( for high schools to track their progress , federal student aid regularly updates estimates for the first 12 months of an application cycle . as of the 2017 18 fafsa cycle , this is extended to the first 15 months of the application cycle and will cover october of one year through december of the following year . ) missing or duplicate high schools why is n't my high school listed in these data files ? there are two primary reasons that you may not see your school on the list . your school will not appear on the report if there are fewer than five completed applications . your school may appear on the report , but it may be listed under an alternative name . since school names are inherently student - reported , the reported name can vary considerably . in aggregating the data , our standard practice is to report the school name that is most commonly reported by applicants . it is possible this name is different than your formal school name . as a result , it is important to look for other variations of your school name and city . you do not need to request to be added to the list . once a high school shows at least five completed fafsa forms , their submission and completion totals will appear in the database . i can not find my high school within the fafsa form 's high school search results . what could be causing this ? how do i go about getting my school included ? with a few exceptions discussed below , most high schools should be contained in our database on the fafsa form . if you can t find your school , double - check your spelling of the city and school name , and then try your search again . also , consider alternate names or cities that may be used . sometimes the official location of the school reported to us is a suburb within a larger city , or vice - versa . if after trying various possibilities you still can not find your institution , you may still continue forward by clicking next . despite being unable to find your school , the information you type in will still be captured and recorded , so be sure the spelling is correct . for public schools , our database should contain every high school in the nation , unless the school was opened , merged , or otherwise changed its name within the past year or two . if you fit into one of these categories , your school may not be listed within the current fafsa form , but will be listed on future fafsa forms . for private schools , our database contains every high school that has participated in the u.s. department of education 's private school survey . visit the national center for education statistics if your private school would like more information . if your private school only recently participated in the survey , your school may not be listed within the current fafsa form , but will be listed on future fafsa forms . why do there appear to be duplicates of the same school ? since these school names are inherently student - reported , the reported name can vary considerably . in aggregating the data , our standard practice is to report the school name that is most commonly reported by applicants . however , when we are unable to determine if school name variations are referring to the same school , we err on the side of caution and do not aggregate the data to a single record and applicant count . in that instance , it may appear that there are duplicates of the same school . email us at hsfafsa @ ed.gov if you believe your school has been listed more than once . low completion totals why is my number of fafsa submissions or completions lower than i think it should be ? while we know that many high schools inadvertently overestimate their fafsa completion rates , one reason your rates may be lower than expected is because your school could be listed more than once . this happens if students entered your school name in different ways on the fafsa form . for instance , if some students listed `` john doe high school `` and other students listed `` doe high school , `` then your high school could be listed in more than one place . please look for alternate names for your school . email us at hsfafsa @ ed.gov if you find your school has been listed more than once . i am a high school counselor or college access professional . what resources do you have to help increase fafsa completion totals ? federal student aid s financial aid toolkit provides federal student aid information and outreach tools for counselors , college access professionals , nonprofit mentors , and others . the site helps counselors understand the basics of federal student aid , provides tips on hosting events along with sample powerpoint presentations , provides suggested messages for social media and email outreach , and helps find other training opportunities . i am a counselor at a high school with a lot of students age 20 or older . why are my numbers so low ? because there is no question on the fafsa form that asks if an applicant is a high school senior , we must use several criteria to identify those applicants that are likely high school seniors . in this instance , the bulk of the students would likely not satisfy the age criteria requiring applicants to be less than 20 years of age at the cutoff date . also , students must also be receiving their high school diploma , as opposed to a ged or other program , to fit this definition of a high school senior . technical and analytical the totals reported last year are different from the numbers reported now about last year . what is causing this ? there could be several causes for this , including the possibility that your institution is listed more than once in the data using alternate variations of the school 's name or city . one other cause is a change we made in 2017 to our definition of a high school senior , which now aligns with other data we publicly release . in past years , we used proxies to determine whether an applicant was a first - time filer ; we now use true first - time filer status as one criterion for being a senior . while this impacts a relatively small number of applicants , if your total decreased compared to what we reported last year , then this may mean there were applicants that had applied in a previous year . can i add up all the submitted applications from a single state file to calculate a state total ? what about adding up all the submitted applications from a single city ? the answer to both questions is no . the official location of a school or the location most commonly reported by students may actually be a suburb falling within a larger city 's limits . for example , adding up all the applications reported under `` new york city `` would exclude any institutions reported being within `` queens `` or even within `` jamaica , `` a smaller neighborhood within the new york city borough of queens . any analysis must also consider the impact of withholding the totals or names of schools with fewer than five completed applications . at its most basic level , summing the number of applications reported in these files always underestimates the number of applications . if an institution is reported as having `` < 5 `` completed applications , one can not assume there were zero applications . further , the totals for some schools are never made public because their class sizes essentially preclude them from having enough completed applications to ever be disclosed publicly . because this impacts some areas more than others , be sure to consider these and other factors when conducting any analyses . why do some districts appear in white on the maps ? districts are listed as missing / insufficient data if any of the following conditions are true : the regulatory adjusted cohort graduation rate is missing e.g. , if districts merged or a new district was created after 2009 10. a district has fewer than 15 students in the regulatory adjusted cohort graduation rate data . there s an unpredicted increase in the number of district graduating seniors e.g. , a dramatic increase in the graduation rate , or if two districts merge under one district 's name . a district has fewer than 10 projected graduates . a district has fewer than five completed fafsa forms . the national center education statistics local education agency lea code does not match the lea code found in the tiger / line shapefile for the state .
